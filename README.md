# Semantic Search with FileMaker 2024
Tutorial file packaged as Beezwax Semantic Search.fmp12

Requires FileMaker 2024 (v21.x)

## Introduction
FileMaker 2024 delivers native semantic search, and it’s awesome. Now you can search records whose text is similar to the semantic meaning of your search term, even if those records don’t include your exact search term. 
Using natural language, users can be freed from trying to recall exactly how data was input.

## Quickstart

You'll need to supply your own AI credentials to use the file (via the gear icon in the top right of the UI).

If you employ credentials that aren't from OpenAI, you'll also need to configure the LLM Embedding Model field and execute the embeddings script (to build embeddings compatible with the embedding model you've chosen).
